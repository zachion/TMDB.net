# TMDB.net
I have developed a **TMDB wrapper**  using Asp.NET MVC 5 
This is a asp.net (web application) project with a two main views (2 pages) for viewing popular movies and
movie specific details information. 

The **Home** page lists all pupular movies whilst the **Details** page contains the movie specific information for each movie. For navigating to the movie specific page the user clicks on each movie title or image from the **Home** page. The **Details** page contains a **Back** button at the bottom line, which takes the user back to the **Home** page. I have also implemented a **Pager** at the bottom of the **Home** page. 

I am  using Visual Studio 2017. 
All information is provided from the TMDB: https://www.themoviedb.org/
