# TMDB.net
I have developed a a TMDB wrapper using Asp.NET MVC 5 
This is a web application with a two main view areas (2 pages) for viewing popular movies and
movie specific information. 

The index view contains a list of all pupular movies. 
The movie details page contains movie specific information for each movie. 

For navigating to the movie specific page the user is supose to click on each movie title or image from the Home page.

The movie details page contains a back button at the bottom line, that takes the user back to the home page.

I have also implemented a pager at the bottom of the Home page. 

I am  using Visual Studio 2017. 

All information is provided from the TMDB https://www.themoviedb.org/
