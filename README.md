# TMDB.net
I have developed a a TMDB wrapper manager using Asp.NET MVC 5 
This is a web application with a two main view areas (2 pages) for viewing popular movies and
movie specific information. 

The index view contains a list of all pupular movies. 
The movie details page contains movie specific information for each movie. 

I am  using Visual Studio 2017. This application makes API calls to the TMDB for this demo.

All information is provided from the TMDB https://www.themoviedb.org/
